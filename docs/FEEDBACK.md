# FEEDBACK for darkmoon.dev

Completed items should be removed from this file. Below are the active tasks we still need to track and prioritize for play testing.

Short actionable checklist

- [ ] Fix Node.js not found in PowerShell â€” see diagnostics and temp PATH fix in issue - we should be able to run all of the commands we need in a venv and npm without PATH issues.
- [ ] Use `TODO.md` to pick next features to implement among other feedback below.

# QA Review

- [ ] home page is good. the market button text expands past the buttons boundaries
- [ ] when starting solo. i can see a giant block on top blocking blue block from view (like its stuck inside at the bottom). so tough to give further feedback. the lightmode/darkmode button is shown on the left middle when it whouls be near th ebottom right. it also doesnt seem to do anytihing when clicked.
- [ ] chat in solo doesnt actually send the message or save it in chat anywhere. might just be a placeholder ofr now? everything else about it works tho!
- [ ] the rightclick and left click interaction are ALMOST what i wanted, but also kinda neat. i more wanted it to behave like world of warcraft where leftclick moves you and rightclick interacts with things. but this is also cool since it allows for more precise movement. maybe we can have both? like leftclick to move, rightclick to interact. maybe we can save these other modes for like a "peek" or something later? (the current right click kinda feels like a peek/overview mode vs left is currently the "rotate camera" i wanted right click to have). i believe in WoW when both are clicked the character stops. when held they move forward and in the direction of the mouse position. so its got a good combination flow. research how WoW does it but still focus on the WASD methods (i cant test it now because a block is on top of us)
