# QA Review

- [ ] the rightclick and left click interaction are ALMOST what i wanted, but also kinda neat. i more wanted it to behave like world of warcraft where leftclick moves you and rightclick interacts with things. but this is also cool since it allows for more precise movement. maybe we can have both? like leftclick to move, rightclick to interact. maybe we can save these other modes for like a "peek" or something later? (the current right click kinda feels like a peek/overview mode vs left is currently the "rotate camera" i wanted right click to have). i believe in WoW when both are clicked the character stops. when held they move forward and in the direction of the mouse position. so its got a good combination flow. research how WoW does it but still focus on the WASD methods (i cant test it now because a block is on top of us)
