# DARKMOON FEEDBACK

Completed items should be removed from this file. Below are the active tasks we still need to track and prioritize for play testing.

- Short actionable checklist

## Instructions

Use `TODO.md` to pick next features to implement but prioritize the feedback below. But if too complex move to the next `PHASE#.md` like `PHASE7.md`. If none are found add these to your current action items and continue working.

## QA Review - Phase 7 - round 1

- [ ] the game doesnt detect desktop vs mobile properly, so desktop sees a tiny screen and has a big scrollbar. our game should always be fullscreen no matter the device. orientation should adjust given the specific device. the joystick should only appear on mobile. use best practices from three.js or other webgl games. whatever framework we are using should have it somewhere.
- [ ] still cant move using WASD keys, the input indicators show its being pressed but character doesnt move.
- [ ] the game still has no sound effects or music. we need at least some placeholder sound effects for walking, jumping, landing, and some ambient music.
- [ ] the tag game menu is in the way. it should be in the top right and take up less space. its currently at the center of the screen and too wide.
- [ ] the game should have a pause menu that can be accessed at any time. it should allow players to resume, restart, or quit the game.
