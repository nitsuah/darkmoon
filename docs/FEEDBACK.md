# FEEDBACK for darkmoon.dev

- nothing loads. hard to give feedback on an empty screen.
- consider adding a loading indicator or placeholder content while the 3D environment initializes.
- the color scheme is quite dark, which fits the "darkmoon" theme, but it may be straining for some users' eyes. consider offering a light mode or adjustable brightness settings.
- navigation controls are not immediately obvious. adding on-screen hints or a brief tutorial for first-time users could enhance usability.
- performance seems to vary significantly based on the device used. optimizing for lower-end hardware or providing graphics settings could improve accessibility.
