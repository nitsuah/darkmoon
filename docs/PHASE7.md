# PHASE 7 IDEAS

- Add mobile controls, map relative joysticks as needed to camera controls or movement. and interaction w/ taps

- Add mobile "layout" mode to rearrange in portrait mode the buttons and joysticks on screen (and the relative camera display too when device is rotated)

- profanity filter doesnt seem to work? or needs more words?

- home screen renders weird on mobile, needs to be responsive and conform to best practices
