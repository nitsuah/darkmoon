# Phase 7 Feedback Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 7 focused on QA feedback implementation and developer experience improvements for AI coding agents.

## Known Limitations

1. **Restart Function**: Currently just unpauses and ends the game. Full position reset could be added later.
2. **Jump/Land Sounds**: Functions exist in SoundManager but not yet triggered (no jumping implemented in game yet).
3. **Music Complexity**: Current background music is simple. Could be enhanced with more complex procedural composition.

## Potential Iterations (Post-QA)

These improvements can be added after current QA feedback is completed:

1. **Game Mode Documentation** - Expand copilot-instructions.md with:

   - Tag/race/collect mode mechanics
   - GameManager state flow and scoring system
   - How game modes integrate with CollisionSystem

2. **Collision System Patterns** - Document common patterns:

   - Player-to-obstacle collision detection
   - Player-to-player collision handling
   - Spatial partitioning and performance optimization

3. **Socket.io Event Flow** - Detail client-server communication:

   - Event sequence for player movement
   - Room management and player synchronization
   - Latency handling and state reconciliation

4. **Performance Optimization Guide** - Add patterns for:
   - Quality settings and adaptive rendering
   - Frame budget management
   - Memory cleanup and disposal patterns

## Next Steps

All Phase 7 feedback has been addressed. Ready for next round of QA testing and feature work!
