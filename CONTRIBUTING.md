| `npm run ci`           | Run all CI checks locally (typecheck, lint, test, build) |

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality:

- Prettier formatting
- ESLint checks (with `--max-warnings=0`)
- TypeScript type checking

Hooks run automatically on commit. To bypass (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

### Manual CI Check

Before pushing, you can run the full CI pipeline locally:

```bash
# PowerShell (Windows)
.\scripts\ci-check.ps1

# Bash (Linux/Mac)
./scripts/ci-check.sh
```

## 🎨 Code Quality

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **React**: Functional components with hooks
- **Formatting**: Prettier with 4-space indentation (see `.prettierrc`)
- **Linting**: ESLint with React, TypeScript, and a11y rules

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run test suite in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
npm run test:ci

# Generate coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in `src/__tests__/`
- Use Vitest and React Testing Library
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not 100%

### Vitest (CI) and Windows / CI stability

We run tests in-process to avoid intermittent worker IPC crashes (EPIPE / ERR_IPC_CHANNEL_CLOSED) that can occur on some CI runners and Windows/node combinations. The project exposes a stable programmatic runner at:

```
node ./scripts/run-tests-inprocess.js
```

Use the npm helper for CI:

```
npm run test:ci
```

This script runs the programmatic (in-process) Vitest runner with the repository's `config/vitest.config.ts` and produces coverage. Prefer this in CI and for pre-push checks.

### jest-dom matcher registration

The repository registers the vitest-compatible jest-dom entry in `config/vitest.setup.ts`:

```ts
import "@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest";
```

Do not import `@testing-library/jest-dom` directly inside test files — it targets Jest and can run before Vitest sets up globals, which causes errors like `ReferenceError: expect is not defined`. ESLint enforces this rule via `no-restricted-imports`.

If you hit test ordering or `expect` errors locally, run:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
npm run test:ci

# Linux/macOS
npm run test:ci
```

If problems persist, try clearing caches and re-running:

```
npm test -- --clearCache
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Environment Variables

#### Frontend (Netlify)

Add in Netlify dashboard (Site settings → Environment variables):

```bash
# WebSocket Server URL (optional)
VITE_SOCKET_SERVER_URL=https://your-websocket-server.com

# Or leave empty to use the same domain as frontend
```

#### WebSocket Server

For Node.js server deployment:

```bash
# Server Port
PORT=4444

# Allowed CORS Origins (comma-separated)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://darkmoon.dev,https://deploy-preview-*--darkmoon.netlify.app
```

### Netlify Deployment

This project auto-deploys to Netlify:

1. **Build Settings:**

   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 18.x or higher

2. **Configuration:**
   - See `netlify.toml` for SPA routing and headers

### WebSocket Server Deployment

Deploy `server.js` to platforms like:

- **Render.com** (recommended for WebSockets)
- **Railway.app**
- **Fly.io**

**Required settings:**

- Start command: `npm start`
- Port: Set by platform (default 4444)
- Environment: Add `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with your Netlify URL

### Health Check

The server exposes a `/health` endpoint:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-02T...",
  "connections": 0
}
```

Use this for monitoring and uptime checks.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Failed

**Symptoms:** "Disconnected - Reconnecting..." message

**Solutions:**

1. Check server is running: `curl https://your-server.com/health`
2. Verify CORS origins include your Netlify URL
3. Check browser console for specific errors
4. Ensure server supports WebSocket upgrades (not just HTTP)

### CORS Errors

**Symptoms:** Browser blocks requests with CORS error

**Solutions:**

1. Add Netlify URL to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on server
2. Use wildcard for preview deploys: `https://deploy-preview-*--darkmoon.netlify.app`
3. Restart server after changing environment variables

### Build Failures

**Symptoms:** Build fails locally or in CI

**Solutions:**

1. Check Node version is 18.x or higher
2. Run `npm install` to verify dependencies
3. Check build logs for specific errors
4. Ensure all required files are committed to git
5. Run `npm run ci` locally to reproduce CI checks

### Test Failures

**Symptoms:** Tests fail in CI but pass locally

**Solutions:**

1. Run `npm run test:ci` locally
2. Check for timing issues or environment-specific code
3. Ensure all mocks are properly configured
4. Clear test cache: `npm test -- --clearCache`

### Coverage Issues

**Symptoms:** Coverage report fails with ENOENT error

**Solutions:**

1. Clean coverage directory: `rm -rf coverage`
2. Run tests again: `npm run test:ci`
3. Check `.gitignore` doesn't block coverage files

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run local checks: `npm run ci`
5. Commit your changes (pre-commit hooks will run automatically)
6. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## 🐳 Docker & Pre-commit Hooks (Windows/WSL2)

**If you are on Windows and want pre-commit hooks to work with Docker:**
- You MUST use WSL2 (Ubuntu or similar) and clone the repo inside the WSL2 filesystem (e.g., `/home/youruser/code/darkmoon`).
- Run all git and Docker commands from inside WSL2.
- The pre-commit hook will run lint-staged in Docker and will work out of the box in this setup.
- If you use Git Bash, PowerShell, or clone the repo on a Windows drive, Docker cannot reliably mount `.git` and the hook will fail.

**If you are not using WSL2:**
- You must have Node.js and npm installed on your host for pre-commit hooks to work.
- Or, bypass the hook with `git commit --no-verify` (not recommended).

See `.husky/pre-commit` for details.

## 🐳 Docker Linting/Formatting

- To check code style before commit, run `npm run lint:docker` (or rely on CI).
- This runs lint-staged and all formatting/linting in a fresh Docker container.
- No git hooks or host Node.js required.
- CI will enforce lint/format/test on all PRs and pushes.
